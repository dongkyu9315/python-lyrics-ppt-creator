191 There Were Ninety and Nine

191 양 아흔 아홉 마리는

- 1
There were nine-ty and nine that safe-ly lay

양 아흔 아홉 마리는

-
In the shel-ter of the fold.

우리에 있으나

-
But one was out on the hills a-way,

한 마리 양은 떨어져

-
Far-off from the gates of gold

길 잃고 헤매네

-
A-way on the moun-tains wild and bare,

산 높고 길은 험한데

-
A-way from the ten-der Shep-herd's care,

목자를 멀리 떠났네

-
A-way from the ten-der Shep-herd's care.

목자를 멀리 떠났네

-

"Lord Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine;

그 아흔 아홉 마리가

-
Are they not enough for Thee?"

넉넉지 않은가

-
But the Shep-herd made answer,

저 목자 힘써 하는 말

-
"This of Mine Has wan-dered a-way from Me,

그 양도 사랑해

-
And al-though the road be rough and steep,

그 길이 멀고 험해도

-
I go to the des-ert to find My sheep.

그 양을 찾을 것이라

-
I go to the des-ert to find My sheep."

그 양을 찾을 것이라

-

But none of the ran-somed ev-er knew

길 잃은 양을 찾으러

-
How deep were the wa-ters crossed;

산 넘고 물 건너

-
Nor how dark was the night that the Lord passed

그 어둔 밤이 새도록

-
Thro' He found His sheep that was

큰 고생하셨네

-
Lost. Out in the des-ert He heard its cry

그 양의 울음소리를

-
Sick and helpless, and ready to die;

저 목자 들으셨도다

-
Sick and helpless, and ready to die.

저 목자 들으셨도다

-

"Lord, whence are those blood-drops all the way

산길에 흘린 피 흔적

-
That mark out the moun-tain's track?"

그 누가 흘렸나

-
"They were shed for one who had gone a-stray Ere

길 잃은 양을 찾느라

-
the Shep-herd could bring him back."

저 목자 흘렸네

-
"Lord, whence are Thy hands so rent and torn?"

손발은 어찌 상 했나

-
"They're pierced to-night by many a thorn;

가시에 찔리셨도다

-
They're pierced to-night by many a thorn."

가시에 찔리셨도다

-




- 5
But all thro' the moun-tains thun-der-riv'n,

저 목자 기쁨 넘쳐서

-
And up from the rock-y steep,

큰 소리 외치며

-
There a-rose a glad cry to the gate of heav'n,

내 잃은 양을 찾았다

-
"Re-joice! I have found my sheep!"

다 기뻐하여라

-
And the an-gels ech-oed a-round the throne,

저 천사 화답하는 말

-
"Re-joice, for the Lord brings back His own!

그 양을 찾으셨도다

-
Re-joice, for the Lord brings back His own!"

그 양을 찾으셨도다
